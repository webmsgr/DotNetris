# DotNetris

## What Dotnetris is about is a play on the classic game Tertis. Using Windows Forms app, we have created a functional game, including a main menu, single player with hard, easy, and normal mode, as well as the beginning stages for multiplayer. Dotnetris uses C# promgraming, entity framework, and a SQL database to store users data to save their login information and/or their scores. 

## How to install, is very simple (this also includes the code) you must have Visual Stuido 2022, go to the green code button and click downlaod zip, once you have done that, you can unzip it anywhere on the computer, after that open the Dotnettris.sln, it will open the project in VS 2022, after that, you can press the > button that is green at the top and experience the game. 

## Use this project as a fun way to engage in a tertis like game, including playing with friends! Keep track of your scores, or even don't and just play for fun!
